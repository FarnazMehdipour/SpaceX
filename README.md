 This project aims to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land. SpaceX offers Falcon 9 launches at around $62 million, compared to over $165 million charged by other providers. A key factor in this cost advantage is SpaceXâ€™s ability to reuse the first stage, significantly reducing launch expenses.
